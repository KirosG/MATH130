## Introduction to the class

* Target audience: Anyone who wants to do their own data analysis!
* Primer to get the complete novice up and running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical programming language R. 
* Topics include: R programming basics, importing data, properties of tidy data, visualizing data, reproducible research with Markdown and basic data wrangling. 
* Designed to get you up and running with basic knowledge of `R` and Markdown ASAP.
* Most upper division Statistics, and all Data Science courses use R heavily. This course is designed as a pre-requisite. 


## Logistics
* **Meeting Times and Locations** TR 2-4pm; MLIB 226;  8/22 - 9/14 (4 weeks) **--NOTE ROOM CHANGE--**
* **Course Website:** https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/
* **[Chico R Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chico-rug)**. This is our discussion forum to ask (and answer) questions outside of class. 
    - There is also a [R Users Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Chico-R-Users-Group/) that is optional but useful if you want to stay connected to the community and learn about upcoming events. 
* **Data Camp:** Online tool to learn R. A link will be emailed to you that will allow you to create an account to join the online classroom class. Be sure to use your real name for credit.  


## Structure of this class

* Content is fully online on the course website.  
* Class time is spent walking through labs and on the spot debugging / expanding on ideas and concepts. 
* After week 4 attendance is optional. 
    - This room is reserved for the entire semester for drop in R help time, short talks and additional workshops on general Data Science topics. 
    - a.k.a "Meet and analyze data"

## Time Committment & Frustration

* Fast paced 1 unit course conducted over 8 days
* Not designed to teach you everything about R, just enough to make you dangerous.

## Why are you learning R? 

I have my reasons for why R is awesomesauce, but what brings you here? 


## Why use R Studio?

- Customizable workspace that docks all windows together. 
- Notebook formats that allow for easy sharing of code and output, and integration with other languages (Python, C++, SQL, STAN)
- Syntax highlighting, warning errors when missing a closing parentheses. 
- Cross-platform interface. Also works on Windows/iOS/Linux.
- Tab completion for functions. Forget the syntax or a variable name? Popup helpers are available. 
- Free training videos available from the developers directly.
- Built in version control 
- One button publishing of reproducible documents such as reports, interactive visualizations ([Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)), presentations, websites (like this one!)


## Why no point and click GUI?

Because it's not reproducible. 

The only possible exception to this is through the use of the [R Commander](http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/). 

_Disclaimer:_ As of this date I have not spent more than 10 minutes playing with it. 

However it looks promising since 

1. It provides you the code that you pointed and clicked to get, 
2. You can create markdown files from it. 

## Getting Help

* Your first resource is each other. Your second resource is Google. 
* Post your question on the Google Group so others can learn from the solution.
* Contribute your own solutions and advice as you can. 
* Prepare a [minimal working example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) of your problem on the forum, it may be helpful to include a screenshot of the problem. 


## Getting Started

* Log into to your Data Camp classroom. 
* You should see a course called "Introduction to R"
* Complete the first module - Building Blocks by the end of class today. 
* Follow the [Software Overview](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/) post to get your computer up and running with the R studio suite of awesomeness by Thursday.
